        <hr />
        <p class="info">
          Hello! I'm Estiven Arboleda, a passionate software developer with extensive experience
           in both corporate environments and freelance projects. From my early days at Renault Sofasa,
            where I delved into PLC programming and robotic machinery, to my collaboration at Arriendalo,
             where I contributed to the fullstack development of a web platform from scratch, 
             I've found my true passion in creating innovative technological solutions.
             I thrive on diving into new challenges and learning about the latest technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
          As a freelancer, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects,
  from web applications to enterprise systems, 
  always staying up-to-date with market trends and applying best development practices.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
          With a strong foundation in technologies such as React, Node.js,
 and both relational and non-relational databases,
  I'm constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills.
   I firmly believe in the importance of lifelong learning and exploring 
   new technologies to stay relevant in such a dynamic field as software development.

        </p>
        <p class="info">
          If you're looking for a committed and passionate developer
 for your next project, I would love to connect with you and explore
  how I can help bring your technological vision to life!
        </p>
